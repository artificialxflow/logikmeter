# LogikMeter Project Explanation

## What is LogikMeter?
LogikMeter is an online platform where people can create, discuss, and vote on important topics, with the added excitement of earning and using a special digital currency called LMC (LogikMeter Coin). The system rewards users for participating in meaningful discussions and voting, making the experience both engaging and rewarding.

## What Can You Do on LogikMeter?
- **Create Topics:** Users can start new topics for discussion. These topics can be about anything that needs group input or logical debate.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** When a topic is created, an AI system helps break it down into clear points, summaries, and logical statements, making it easier for everyone to understand and discuss.
- **Edit and Publish:** Users can review and edit the AI's analysis before making the topic public.
- **Start Discussions:** Once a topic is published, users can invite others to join a timed discussion about it.
- **Vote on Outcomes:** After the discussion, there's a voting period where participants can vote on the best arguments or solutions.
- **Earn Rewards:** Users earn LMC coins for creating topics, participating in discussions, and voting. These coins can be transferred between users.

## How Does It Work?
1. **Sign Up:** Users register with an email or Google account. Each user gets a digital wallet with some free LMC coins to start.
2. **Create or Join Topics:** Users can create new topics or join existing ones. The AI helps structure the topic for clarity.
3. **Timed Discussions:** Discussions are time-limited (e.g., 1 hour), encouraging focused and active participation.
4. **Voting:** After the discussion, there's a short voting window (e.g., 15 minutes) where participants vote on the outcome.
5. **Rewards:** The system automatically distributes LMC coins to the topic creator and discussion participants based on their involvement.
6. **Wallet and Transfers:** Users can view their LMC balance, see their transaction history, and send coins to others.
